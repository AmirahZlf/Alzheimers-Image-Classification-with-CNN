CNN models excel at recognizing complex patterns in image data and capable of labeling MRI data to differentiate between healthy brains, early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s, and advanced stages of the disease.

The dataset consists Alzheimer's MRI scan images that segregated into 4 classes: Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented.

Model: CNN built from scratch and TensorFlow's Keras API pretrained (ResNet50 & EfficientNetB7)
